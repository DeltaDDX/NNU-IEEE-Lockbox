# TODOs

## Power saving
implement sleep on nano every wake using IRQ pin on RFID general power management: turn off devices when not in use (screen, LEDs...)

## Persistent memory for the card UID
eeprom

## RFID compatability
RFID needs fix: new tag, so new library. The current library only reads MIFARE classic tags. we have NTAG213 (see "NCF ReWriter" in GitHub to write/read from the tags. Simply put: thes tags have different data fields mapped to different pages of memory. Probably something we'll have to save for a future iteration the design.
